This project was created with the following purposes:

* Be a personal sandbox for testing new React features and its libraries
* A reference for how to do somethings in frontend
* Last but not least, a prank with a close friend to count how many social events he didn't participated

This was built using React, React Query and Material UI at this point.

This project complements the [API](https://github.com/jpmoura/g13-wall-of-shame-api).
